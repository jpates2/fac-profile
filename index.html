              <div class="story-text">
                <p>Hi, nice to meet you! I'm Jess, 33 years old and a career switcher hoping to make it as a Software Developer. I'm Manchester born and raised, and now a long time London resident, with a brief interlude living in sunny Barcelona last year.</p>
                <p>I love living in London as there's always something fun to do and somewhere new to explore. Sports have always been my favourite way to keep busy and meet new people. I’ve always appreciated exercise for both the physical and mental health aspects, as well as the opportunity to try something new, push myself and become part of a community. I've played football and hockey since I was young and love being part of a team. During the covid lockdowns I grew to love cycling - it was a chance to explore London whilst it was deserted and it gave my otherwise empty weekends some structure. I still enjoy the feeling of freedom it brings, even if that is curtailed somewhat by London and its hectic roads. More recently I've joined a running club as I'm trying to tolerate, and hopefully one day enjoy, long distance running.</p>
                <p>I'm friendly, humble, conscientious and hardworking. I can be a little reserved at first, just while I get comfortable with new people and new surroundings. I have a relaxed and easygoing attitude, and try not to take myself or life too seriously!</p>

            <div class="story-snippet hidden" id="work-snippet">
              <div class="story-text-title">Work Experience</div>
              <div class="story-text">
                <p>I have ten years experience working in financial services operations. Initially I worked for the Bank of New York before moving on to smaller hedge funds. I gained a lot of industry specific knowledge over these years, but more importantly I developed personally. My self-belief and confidence in my own abilities grew over time, as did my resilience and ability to adapt. It can be a fairly demanding environment to work in but I got used to juggling various tasks at once and managing tight deadlines. Luckily I have a calm temperament so wasn't too phased by the high pressure or demanding traders.</p>
                <p>Over time I became increasingly aware that this wasn't my forever career. I never had negative feelings towards my work, but I also never had particularly positive ones. It just felt a little too boring and same-y, and had me wondering what else I could be doing instead. It never lit my world alight but I'm still grateful for my time working in that industry and how it's led me to this point today.</p>
                <p>The challenge was to figure out what I would be better suited to instead!</p>

            <div class="story-snippet hidden" id="leap-snippet">
              <div class="story-text-title">The Big Leap</div>
              <div class="story-text">
                <p>During the various waves of Covid, when we all had a little more time on our hands, I got stuck into a few basic courses on Codecademy. It was fun to be learning something new and it seemed to open an ideal opportunity to explore a new career path, whilst making the most of my skills and way of thinking.</p>
                <p>My previous jobs have involved elements of logical thinking and problem solving, as well as a need to be fairly comfortable around tech and working with numbers. Software Development seemed to be an ideal transition, where I could use my skills and knowledge but instead direct it towards something that I found more fun and interesting.</p>
                <p>From there, I made the leap to leave my job and enrol in a Web Development bootcamp. And if leaving behind my safe, stable job wasn't enough of a change, I decided to head to Barcelona to do the bootcamp. I wanted a little bit of instability and adventure, and to have a break from the normal routine. I was in Spain for almost nine months in total and combined the bootcamp with learning Spanish and just experiencing life in another country. It was a hugely fun and rewarding time and I'm glad I decided to make the change. My view is that work should be enjoyed and not just endured. It's such an enourmous part of life and I want it to bring me some satisfaction as well as challenge me. That was the motivation behind my career transition and defines my search for a new job.</p>

            <div class="story-snippet hidden" id="bootcamp-snippet">
              <div class="story-text-title">Bootcamp</div>

              <div class="story-text">
                <p>I completed Le Wagon's Web Development bootcamp at the end of 2022. It was an intensive full-time course that spanned nine weeks. The focus was Ruby on Rails, with HTML, CSS, SQL and JavaScript also being covered too. Each day we had a morning lesson covering a new topic before we spent the bulk of the day working through coding challenges with a buddy. Towards the end of the course we completed two projects in groups of four. The first was a marketplace, with our site allowing users to rent artwork for events or public space. The second was a mobile-first site brining together football fans during the World Cup, allowing users to find and attend events with supporters of the same team.</p>
                <p>My honest assessment of the bootcamp is that it was a truly humbling experience! Having to start again from the basics after years working within another career was tough. I had to learn to embrace regular failure as a means to making progress. I loved my time on the bootcamp, being able to learn something new every day and then take stock at the end and see just how far I’d come. I also hugely enjoyed the camaraderie of it, everyone in it together and pitching in to help each other when things got tough. </p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="story-snippet hidden" id="post-snippet">
              <div class="story-text-title">Post Bootcamp</div>
              <div class="story-text">
                <p>After completing the bootcamp, I stayed in Barcelona for another six months. I spent my mornings learning Spanish in group classes, then during the afternoon would further my coding knowledge with the help of Udemy courses. During that time my particular focus was JavaScript, with some TypeScript too.</p>
                <p>I came back to London at the end of summer last year to focus fulltime on self-taught coding, with the aim of securing an entry level role at some point. I've made huge progress with the depth and breadth of my knowledge, all through solo-led learning. My JavaScript skills have improved greatly, and I've branched out into React too. I've also spent some time brushing up on SQL and on frontend styling with CSS and Tailwind. I have several personal proejcts that I'm proud of, with each allowing me to put something new into practice and problem solve on the go. It's always fun starting a new project from scratch, and I've got a little better each time at structuring my work and managing the process.</p>
                <p>What continues to allude me though is that first job! It's proving tricky to land, not helped by the less than ideal current job market. I keep aiming to learn a little more each day, and hope that eventually this, combined with a positive, proactive mindset will see me succeed sooner rather than later.</p>

            <div class="story-snippet hidden" id="fac-snippet">
              <div class="story-text-title">Why FAC</div>
              <div class="story-text">
                <p>As much as I've loved the last year of solo-learning and being able to direct my focus wherever I like, it's been a tough and lonely process at times too. I'm grateful for this break that I've had, but I'm really keen to find a role that I can put my energy and passion into.</p>
                <p>I think the FAC foundation training would provide the teaching and support that I really need right now. It would be useful to cover JavaScript, HTML and CSS in a structured, classroom environment again, especially now that everything isn't so new to me - there will be things that I missed during my bootcamp as there was just so much information all at once. I'm also excited to get stuck into some new topics in AWS and AI engineering. I know very little about either currently, but both intrigue me and seem really useful. Most of all, I would look forward to learning alongside others again, and helping each other progress. I really enjoy the diverse groups brought together in this kind of situation, with everyone having a completely different background and skillset but a common goal.</p>
                <p>I'm hoping that FAC can help me turn my knowledge and skills into the start of a career. An apprenticeship would offer the ideal combination of structured learning and on the job training, which would give me the best possible foundations for a long career in Software Development. I only discovered FAC this week but I've put my full effort into the application process as it's something that I would love to be a part of!</p>

            <div class="story-snippet hidden" id="web-dev-snippet">
              <div class="story-text-title">Why Software Development</div>
              <div class="story-text">
                <p>What excites me most is the almost endless potential to keep learning. There's so many different languages and technologies, and so many different ways to use them. The tech world is also constantly changing - it's a completely different landscape to ten years ago, and it will have entirely transformed again in ten years time. It'd be fun to be part of this ever-evolving industry.</p>
                <p>The idea of being able to design and build something tangible with a real impact is another big draw. My career transition centred on wanting to feel more connected to my work, to see the results of my efforts and to feel like there was a purpose. Software Development offers all of this as you can see the progression from idea, to design, building, and then a final product.</p>
                <p>Being able to think logically and strategically to navigate complex problems is another aspect of Software Development that really appeals to me and my way of thinking. The process of analysing a problem, breaking it down into manageable components, and devising a logical path to a solution is how I naturally like to think and manage situations. I also really appreciate that there is the opportunity for creativity intertwined with the more methodical thinking. Writing lines of code is central to the job but it’s not all there is. There’s scope to be inventive in how you approach the problem, how you go about tackling it and the end product that is crafted</p>
